Using the provided Visual Studio solution, develop an angularjs directive which displays a list of service centres.
The directive should:
1.	Display a list of nearby service centres to the user browser
2.	Display the list ordered by distance from the user current location
3.	List for each service centre its name, image, address, phone and URL using correct semantic mark-up
4.	Allow multiple instances of the directive work side-by-side on the same page
5.	Have 400 pixels’ width and limit the results to nearest 4 service centres 
6.	Work well on Edge, Chrome, Firefox

Use the provided solution as your stating point, build on it, introduce whatever is missing, provide unit testing for the introduced code.
